SheScreen: Take control of your health


We've developed an app to help biological females take control of their health. We're providing users with information on cancer screenings from the National Institute of Health and giving them a reminder tool to schedule a screening with their provider. 



We're using a Serverless Framework with AWS on the backend and looking into hosting on GitHub or Netlify for the front end.
